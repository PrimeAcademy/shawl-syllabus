# Tier 3 and Solo Project Kickoff

How to get started with solo projects and setting the tone for Tier 3.

## Welcome to Tier 3!

You have made it! You are here! Tier 2 is in the past and you are Ready To Rock your next project!

Even though we call this a "Solo" Project, you will very much need each other to get through it! For Prime's part, we are starting the slow transition from very much holding your hand to getting you ready and used to being self-sufficient for your first job!

This may be uncomfortable but it's OK. We are always here if you need us.

However, over the next six weeks, we will ask more and more of you to find ways to help youselves.

## Ground Rules

- Being at Prime from 9am to 5pm is still the minimum expectation
    - Absences will still need to be cleared with instructors, meetings with potential employers are great, please give instructors several days notice if possible
- Be on time
  - 9am standup is not a suggestion. Your group is counting on you to be there.
- **Do not plan like you will have 40 hours per week of Class Time to work on your project. You will not.**
    - You will have lectures, guest speakers, public speaking, etc. during solo project time.
    - Do not ask to skip Professional Skills/Speaking, guest speakers, presentations from other cohorts, or any other scheduled activity.
    - Your planning is your responsibility. This aligns with the work environment of most companies in the industry where you will have meetings, continuous learning, conferences, etc. around which to schedule.
    - Create Trello board or Github Project and start to plan tasks
- Working outside of the classroom is a privilege
    - If you aren't able to be at stand ups on time or if you are not paying attention to Slack, you will be asked to move back to the classroom.
- Be attentive to Slack
    - Especially if you are not in the room, you need to pay attention to Slack. We don't have time to chase you down.
- Continue to do your feedback. We don't hear from you as much when you're working on your solo project, let us know what's up.
- **DO** ask questions.


## Asking Questions

Here is the process for how to ask a question:

1. Use your debugger and read the errors.
1. Google / Stack Overflow
1. Ask your neighbor (Yes, we're aware they don't know everything about your project, so ask them a clear question and show them what you have tried.)
1. Use the GitHub Issues board to request Instructor assistance
  
We like helping. This is the order, not so that we can avoid helping you, but this is how your real job will work. We can't give you the answer if you haven't tried things. This is practice. At work, by the time you ask your senior/lead developer, you should have a clear list of things you have tried and what you think might be happening. You're proving you value their time. We hope your future co-workers like answering questions as much as we do, but you will burn them out quickly if it's clear you didn't put in any effort before asking the question.

## Start and End of Day Processes

Schedule these on your cohort calendar!

The morning stand ups plus the closing of day huddle form the main structure from which you can check in daily with students and the cohort at large. Use this time to do some encouragement, advice, make announcements, review the calendar for the next couple of days, etc. 

Make it fun and try to engage the students! You are their manager at this time and you will need to be the cheerleader and on some days, the driver of their motivation!

## Daily Morning Standup Process

This mimicks an agile/scrum stand up meeting. The purpose is to minimally check in on the entire team, as a team. And the goal is to keep it short enough where standing during the check in is comfortable. If you're standing talking long enough to want to sit down, it's TOO LONG!

Each day, each person in the pod will answer these questions aloud to the rest. Note that students should focus on getting things done, hence question 2.

1. Did you do your feedback yesterday?
2. What did you accomplish yesterday?
3. What are you working on today?
4. Do you have any blockers?

Instructors should make it a point to take part in these on a daily basis to help train on how it works, answer questions, and keep tabs on students. If a student mentions several days in a row they are working on the same thing... it's time to check in on that and ask why it isn't a blocker.

**Being present at student ups can be done in several ways:**

- Set each pod's time: 9:00, 9:10, 9:20, 9:30 so you can skip from one to the next. Remember, these are supposed to be VERY SHORT!
- Pick one each day and rotate through the pods. Easier on you but not as effective for daily monitoring.


## End Of Day Huddle

Your cohort time may be different but near the "end of day" you need to bring everyone back together and check in on how the day went. 

Be sure to prepare for the EOD as some days you will need to clarify what the next day or two will look like. You need to give students a heads up on planning their own time!

For the students, this is a time celebrate their successes and recognize friends and who helped them today. Feel free to mix up the questions you ask or your own cohort's vibe, but you should include prompt each student answers.

**These are great starters:**

- What is something you are proud of today?
    - This focuses on the positives for today. Some days will be rough for developers (I got nothing done!) and that is OK! Remember you are helping to model the daily grind and persistance that software development takes!
- Thank at least one other person (can be anyone for any reason)
    - Keeps it positive and encourages helping others so they can get a public thank you. 
    - Also enforces that this is not an individual effort!


## Organize Students into New Pods

Student pods/groups are the first line of defense and avenue for help to students in Tier 3.
