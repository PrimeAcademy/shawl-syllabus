# UX Student Review

- Two 30-minute sessions where UXers are divided up between the Development groups
    - An explanation of the problem (without showing the product)
    - UX review and feedback of current solution
        - Before beginning, Full Stack students should be reminded that the most value can be gained through listening and they should refrain from becoming defensive or immediately justifying the decisions they have made. Ideas sugggested by UX are not required to be implemented, just a new way of looking at the project. Different UXers may also have varying or contradictory opinions. That's ok, it's important for the full stack team to listen.
    - At the end of 30 minutes, UXers should switch to the next group and repeat the process.
