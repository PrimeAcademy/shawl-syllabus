## Spike Weekend Project Presentation

Students will briefly present their spikes. [Details from Week 13](../week-13-auth-scoping/13-03_solo-spike-intro.md)

TL;DR for this presentation:

> The demo presentation will include you showing some sort of output (DOM, API response, e.g.) and then also talking a bit about how the code seems to be working/not working.


## Solo/Tier 3 Kick-off

Properly set the tone and expectations for Tier 3 and the Solo Project in a short intro/lecture.

Namely around attendance, how to get help, etc.

## Solo Scope Review

Kept in Week 13. [Scoping Review Process](../week-13-auth-scoping/13-04_solo-scope-review-process.md)

Final Drafts of student Solo project scopes are due the start of Monday. First priority is to review, provide feedback/guidance, and approve all project scopes. The goal is to be complete by EOD Tuesday. You probably did a ton of the feedback last week with another instructor.

In the meantime, students may begin working if they have turned in the Weekend Project (scope final draft).


## Hand Out Solo Project Starter Repo

Hand this out. Note that the README has lots of set-up insructions as well as short videos that recap the following. These are not full lectures, more like reminders, they are < 10 mins each.

1. secure set-up
2. server routes and their purpose
3. client code organization
