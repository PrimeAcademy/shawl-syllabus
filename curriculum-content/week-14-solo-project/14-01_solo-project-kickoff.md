# Solo Project Kickoff

How to get started with solo projects.

## Ground Rules
- Being at Prime from 9am to 5pm is still the minimum expectation
    - Absences will still need to be cleared with instructors, meetings with potential employers are great, please give instructors several days notice if possible
- Be on time
  - 9am standup is not a suggestion. Your group is counting on you to be there.
- **Do not plan like you will have 40 hours per week to work on your project. You will not.**
    - You will have lectures, guest speakers, public speaking, etc. during solo project time.
    - Do not ask to skip Toast Masters, guest speakers, presentations from other cohorts, or any other scheduled activity.
    - Your planning is your responsibility. This aligns with the work environment of most companies in the industry where you will have meetings, continuous learning, conferences, etc. around which to schedule.
    - Time to create Entity Relationship Diagrams (How will you store data?)
    - Create Trello board or Github Project and start to plan tasks
- Working outside of the classroom is a privilege
    - If you aren't able to be at stand ups on time or if you are not paying attention to Slack, you will be asked to move back to the classroom.
- Be attentive to Slack
    - Especially if you are not in the room, you need to pay attention to Slack. We don't have time to chase you down.
- Continue to do your feedback. We don't hear from you as much when you're working on your solo project, let us know what's up.
- **DO** ask questions.

## Asking Questions

Here is the process for how to ask a question:

1. Use your debugger and read the errors.
1. Google / Stack Overflow
1. Ask your neighbor (Yes, we're aware they don't know everything about your project, so ask them a clear question and show them what you have tried.)
1. Use the Help board.
  
We like helping. This is the order, not so that we can avoid helping you, but this is how your real job will work. We can't give you the answer if you haven't tried things. This is practice. At work, by the time you ask your senior/lead developer, you should have a clear list of things you have tried and what you think might be happening. You're proving you value their time. We hope your future co-workers like answering questions as much as we do, but you will burn them out quickly if it's clear you didn't put in any effort before asking the question.

## Standup Process

- Did you do your feedback yesterday?
- What did you do yesterday?
- What are you working on today?
- Do you have any blockers?
- In Group Client Projects: Did you make a PR yesterday?


## End Of Day Huddle

At 430p every day we'll huddle up in the classroom. We want you to remember you arent alone in this process, so come and celebrate your successes and shout out your friends who helped you today!
