# Pre-Mortem

Each person should write these lists individually

1. "Imagine it is 3 weeks from now and your project has failed. What does that mean? How did it happen?" - 3 minutes (writing privately)
2. Convert these to non-acusatory/non-blaming statements (if any of them are) - 1 minutes
3. "Imagine it is 3 weeks from now and your project has succeeded. What does that mean? How did it happen?" - 2 minutes (writing privately)

Now dicuss these as a group. Start with each person reading their entire list of failures. Don't skip any that you wrote, because your concerns and needs can't be met if you don't address them.
