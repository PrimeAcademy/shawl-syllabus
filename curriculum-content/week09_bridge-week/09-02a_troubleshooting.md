# Troubleshooting Revisited

[Starter repo](https://github.com/PrimeAcademy/troubleshooting-todo-starter)

## Objectives

- Reinforce the **_Describe / Isolate / Fix_ paradigm** for troubleshooting
- Introduce strategies for **troubleshooting errors across the full stack**
- **Review debugging tools**, in the context of full-stack troubleshooting (console logs, Postman, Postico)
- Introduce the the **Chrome Network Panel**, as a tool for debugging AJAX requests
- Introduce the **Chrome Debugger**, as a tool for debugging client-side code
  
## Describe / Isolate / Fix

Remember: 

1. **Describe**
   > What do you want to happen? What is actually happening?
2. **Isolate**
   > Where exactly is the problem happening?
3. **Fix**
   > Change **one thing**, and test your changes.

## Debugging the Full Stack

With the server and database added to our stack, we have many new types of possible errors. It's important to ask yourself:

> **Where in the stack is my error?**

- Client side
- Server side
- Database
- Somewhere in between (eg. AJAX)

In other words, **isolate** your error in the stack.

We have tools to help us isolate our errors:

- Chrome Network Panel
- Postman
- Postico
- Debugger

Using these tools may feel like extra work at first. But investing in these tools will pay off big in the long run! You spend _most_ of your time as a developer debugging code: building this skill will make you a more productive engineer.

## Demo: A Buggy Todo App üêõ ‚úÖ

Setup the starter repo:
- Fork and clone: https://github.com/PrimeAcademy/troubleshooting-todo-starter
- Setup the database, called `troubling-todos`, using the `database.sql` file
- `npm install`
- `npm start`
- Open `http://localhost:5000`

## HTTP Errors

An **HTTP Error** is a message from our express server that something went wrong. 

Every HTTP Error has a **status code**, which indicates what happened. In error responses, we'll mostly see two status codes:

- 404: Not Found
- 500: Internal Server Error

### 404 Errors
  
When we try to add a task, we see an error like: 

> POST http://localhost:5000/task 404 (Not Found)

This is our server telling us that there is not a matching _endpoint_ for `POST /task`. In other words, our request URL+method does not match a URL+method on the server:

```js
// client.js
// Send a request to POST /task
$.ajax({
  method: 'POST',
  url: '/task',
  data: { newTask } // shorthand for { newTask: newTask }
})
```

```js
// server.js
app.use('/tasks', tasksRouter)

// tasks.router.js
// Listen for requests to POST /tasks
router.post('/', (req, res) => {
```

Our server is listening for `POST /tasks`, but we are sending a request to `POST /task`.

Let's fix this on the client:

```js
$.ajax({
  method: 'POST',
  url: '/tasks',    // ‚ùó add an "s"
  data: { newTask }
})
```

### 500 Errors

Now we when add an task, we get a new error:

> POST http://localhost:5000/tasks 500 (Internal Server Error)

**If you see 500 error, *ALWAYS* look at your server logs!**

Your server logs are in your terminal (ie. where you ran `npm start`).

You may see something like:

![partial server log](./images/server-log-partial.png)

That's not super useful üòï. You need to **scroll up** to see the beginning of the error message!

![scroll](./images/server-logs-scroll.gif)

The actual error message is:

> POST /tasks query error: error: null value in column "todo_text" of relation "tasks" violates not-null constraint

This is an error from our Postgres database.

### Database errors

To _isolate_ this backend error we need to know:

> Is this an error with our SQL, or with our server side code?

We can use Postico to help us here. Copy paste the SQL code into Postico, replacing `$1` with an actual string:

```sql
INSERT INTO tasks
  (todo_text)
VALUES
  ('fix a bug');
```

No error in Postico! So we now know that our SQL is valid. The error must live somewhere else.

### Testing the server

Make a request to `POST /task`, with this data:

```js
{
  "task_text": "Fix a bug",
  "is_done": false
}
```

This seems to work. The bug must lie elsewhere.

### "In-Between" Errors

Sometimes our client code is correct, our server code is correct, our SQL code is correct, but we still have bugs. The problems lies in between, in the network requests  between the different systems (eg. AJAX).

Chrome has a _Network Panel_ which can help us debug AJAX requests:

![network panel](./images/network-panel.gif)

Try adding another task: you should see new request to `POST /tasks` in your network panel. Then select the **payload** tab:

![payload](./images/network-payload.png)

This tells us that we are sending `{ is_done: false }` to the server. We are missing our `todo_text` data! So something is wrong with our AJAX request:

```js
  const newTask = $('#taskInput').val();

  // Log the `newTask` variable, to see what's up
  console.log('newTask', newTask);

  // Are we using the right jquery selector?
  console.log(`$('#taskInput')`, $('#taskInput'));

  $.ajax({
    method: 'POST',
    url: '/tasks',
    data: { 
      todo_text: newTask,
      is_done: false
    }
  })
```

We have a bad selector! It should be:

```js
const newTask = $('#task-input').val();
```

### Rendering errors

One last bug: The task is showing up as `undefined` on the DOM:

![undefined](./images/task-undefined.png)

This is a rendering error, lets look at the render function:

```js
function renderTasks(taskList) {
  // Empty the table body:
  $('#the-tasks').empty();

  // Loop through the array of task objects:
  for (let task of taskList) {
    let cssClass = task.is_done ? 'complete' : '';
    // Append a task as a table row:
    $('#the-tasks').append(`
      <tr class="${cssClass}" data-id=${task.id}>
        <td>
          <button class="delete-button">üóë</button>
        </td>
        <td>
          <button class="complete-button">‚úîÔ∏è</button>
        </td>
        <td>
          ${task.todoText}  <!-- üëà why is this undefined -->
        </td>
      </tr>
    `)
  }
}
```

What's going on here? If we could only _pause_ the script and see what's going on...

#### The Debugger

See [notes on using the Chrome Debugger](./debugger.md)

- Put a breakpoint inside the `for` loop
- Use the debugger to step through the loop for each task: see how this bit of code runs multiple times!
- See the local `task` variable, and look closely at its properties

Does `task` object have a property called `todoText`? Look at the actual properties of the `task` variable. It has a `todo_text` property, not `todoText`.

```js
  <td>
    ${task.todo_text}
  </td>
```
